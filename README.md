# Dataset name: Heart Rate Time Series
# Online Access: http://ecg.mit.edu/time-series/ 
# Type: Time series data based on two different subjects
# Description and Potential Application and Values: This time series data set contains 1800 measurements of heart rates from two different subjects.  The two subjects were engaged in similar activity during the measurements.  Analysis of data sets such as these would potentially yield great value.  For example, being able to compare the rate at which each subject’s heart rate returns back to its baseline heart rate after a specific activity would give an idea as to the subject’s preparedness for certain activities.  If these time series data sets were analyzed in conjunction with other data sets, such as rates of injury, rates of victory and loss in sporting events etc., then it might be possible to determine ideal or preferred capabilities of one’s heart prior to engaging in certain activities.

# Personal Thoughts: While of course a broad topic, the book titled “Statistical Inference via Data Science” https://moderndive.com/ is of interest to me in that it is one of the primary areas I wish to become knowledgeable in.  It is one thing to know how to use the different applications, such as R, Python, SASS ect., but it is another thing to know how to apply the correct statistical principles to derive true value.
